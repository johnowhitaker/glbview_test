# glbview_test

glbview_test - testing a way to view things made in Open Brush. Don't use this code - look at https://github.com/icosa-gallery/icosa-viewer

Using this to mint on HEN:
- Export your ObenBrush Sketch to .glb
- Put the glb in this folder (where test_scene.glb is)
- Edit the title and path the the glb file in index.html
- Chenge the thumbnail
- Compress the parent folder (glbview_test) making sure not to include the .git subfolder
- Mint :)

No guarentee this works <3
